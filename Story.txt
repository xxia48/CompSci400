There's an king trying to teach his son to read, and they decided to start by learning alphabet. The king thought that making the alphabet a song could render it easier to memorize it, and there it goes the song: "A for apple, B for ball. C for cat, d for dog..." Now my smart collaborator, could you help the king to finish that song? Hint:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3U3XR-pYto
